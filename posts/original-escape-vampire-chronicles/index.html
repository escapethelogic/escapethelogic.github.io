<p>Escape Room Original is one of the first escape rooms in Bangalore, and they put a great effort into making the clues interesting and intriguing. So, we wanted to try out their horror-themed room to check out the ambiance they have created and also the puzzles. Hence, we arrived to play Vampire Chronicles. Even though I personally hate Vampires (except Count Dracula, of course. Sorry Twilight lovers), but I was looking forward to some spooky, creepy, puzzle-solving experiences. And I am pretty sure the feeling was the same among the group. So we were a group of 4 people. We were quickly briefed about the backstory and a few other essentials and soon we were in the room.</p>

<h3 id="escape-room-original">Escape Room Original</h3>

<p>As claimed by them, Escape Room Original is one of the first escape rooms in Bangalore. But don&rsquo;t take that as a negative thing. They are not outdated or less interesting at all. If anything, their puzzles are super interesting and the entire ambiance is really greatly put. I can&rsquo;t emphasize my love for their style of puzzles and clues. If you love breaking your head over some tricky riddles and crafty puzzles, you definitely need to visit them.</p>

<h3 id="the-room-vampire-chronicles">The Room - Vampire Chronicles</h3>

<p>So the backstory of the room, as you might expect, is related to a war between vampires and humans. You hold the key to end this war but you are trapped inside this castle by the Vampire King and you need to escape! An important thing about rooms in Escape Room Original is there are few things in the backstory that might be important inside the room. So when they brief the details, listen carefully!</p>

<h4 id="ambience">Ambience</h4>

<p>As you would expect in a horror-themed escape room, it has an eerie and spooky feeling. Some parts of the room are completely dark and all you have is a flashlight to guide you, which adds to the entire ambiance. The interior has that feeling of a Vampire King&rsquo;s castle. It&rsquo;s classy, but spooky at the same time. And not only is the ambiance creepy, but some of the puzzle-solving is pretty scary as well. Though there are no jump scares but for the most part, it&rsquo;s a fun, spooky experience.</p>

<h4 id="clues">Clues</h4>

<p>I personally love the clues in this game. It has a combination of a lot of things! You will need to think out-of-the-box at times. There&rsquo;s pattern matching, solving well-crafted riddles, and even performing certain sensor-based action. All in all, it&rsquo;s a good mix of everything and there is something for everyone in this room. One special thing about this room, that you are gonna be briefed about before the game is a concept called <strong>Death Trap</strong>. I am not gonna say much about what it is in this blog, but I can guarantee you that you will just love the absolute brilliance of it. There are certainly a lot of locks to open, some tricky to figure out, some straight forward but only leading you to the next clue. You need to think fast as well as act fast.</p>

<h4 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s a mix of simple clues and tricky riddles. The room isn&rsquo;t super difficult but more tricky at certain points. In some parts, you really need to think clearly and connect the dots, and that should help. I would say it&rsquo;s a little challenging, given the number of puzzles and locks you need to solve, but it&rsquo;s a lot of fun as well. It will definitely keep you on your toes all the time, expecting swift thinking and swift actions, and a good amount of teamwork.</p>

<p>In conclusion, if you have fantasized about living in a spooky vampire filled world ruled by a Vampire King, this is a great room! Also, if you are really into riddles and clues, you are gonna have an amazing time and is a must-visit! I can&rsquo;t think of a reason why you won&rsquo;t spend your Halloween or a Friday the 13th in this room.</p>

<p>PS: We were the 4th fastest solver of this room ever!</p>
