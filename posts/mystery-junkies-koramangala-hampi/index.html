<p>On a Saturday evening, I got bored and was thinking about what I can do to get rid of this boredom and as expected I suddenly cooked up a plan for Escape Room.</p>

<p>Now, that I made up my mind on visiting one, I messaged Saptak about it. After 15 minutes I got a reply &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s meet at <a href="https://mysteryjunkies.com/escape-rooms-koramangala">Mystery Junkies Koramangala</a> in half an hour.&rdquo; Then I realized sudden plans do work. After half an hour we four (Sayan, Saptak, Gaurav and I) met at Mystery Junkies.</p>

<h3 id="mystery-junkies-koramangala">Mystery Junkies Koramangala</h3>

<p>Mystery Junkies is no doubt an amazing place. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. If you are trying an Escape Room for the first time then they&rsquo;ll explain to you few necessary things like what kind of locks you&rsquo;ll find inside the room, how to open the locks or how to reset the locks if you did something wrong. They have a separate briefing room for these discussions. They will monitor all the activities of the room and if you do something, which is not related to the game then they&rsquo;ll play a buzzer sound to let you know.</p>

<p>Quickly now let’s move ahead and know the story behind the room, <a href="https://mysteryjunkies.com/booking?roomid=16">The Ruins of Hampi</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-room-the-ruins-of-hampi">The Room - The Ruins of Hampi</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampi">Hampi</a>, located in southern India in the state of Karnataka was known for its wealth. The grand Hindu Kingdom was filled with numerous temples, monolithic sculptures, and monuments. But over time, all that remains now are ruins and hence attracts archaeologists from all over the world.</p>

<p>The story revolves around three Mystical Golden Bells which has been hiding in the ruins of Hampi. Y’all, as a team of archaeologists, have to find your way to the temple ruins and recover those bells in 60 mins before the raiders get hold of it.</p>

<h4 id="ambience">Ambience</h4>

<p>Immersive, that’s what Mystery Junkies focusses on and we have to say that they live up to their words. You start in a dingy garage of the archaeologist, with dim yellow lights. Sensors, Sensors, Sensors! The room has very few locks and mostly sensors that get activated by a certain action. This makes the experience more interesting.</p>

<h4 id="clues">Clues</h4>

<p>Whatever you will see around might be a clue. To escape the room within 60 minutes, you have to work as a team and examine the little things. You need to be very attentive, and observant about the clues. They don&rsquo;t have any distractions like many other escape rooms, so once you find something that looks like a clue, it should be pretty easy to proceed to the next step. This room expects the team to be good at solving riddles as well as quick on your feet and teamwork is super important</p>

<h4 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h4>

<p>The room is not that easy. You will face a couple of difficulties if you aren’t observant about the surroundings and miss a thing or two. Overall, the difficulty can be set between medium to high for someone who has done an escape room before. Those who are visiting for the first time might find it a little difficult.</p>

<p>The people at mystery junkies claim that it is the easiest and cheapest way to get a feel of Hampi for 60 mins. You just go inside the room and be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones">Indiana Jones</a> in the ruins of Hampi!!</p>
